  "S 25 PDPA": "This provision is directly relevant because the university is asking about the legality of indefinite retention of alumni data. S 25 PDPA mandates that an organisation must cease retaining documents containing personal data or remove the means by which the data can be associated with individuals when the purpose for which the data was collected is no longer being served, and retention is no longer necessary under the PDPA or any other written law. Therefore, the university cannot retain the data indefinitely if these conditions are met.",
  "S 18(1) PDPA": "This provision is relevant because it limits the collection of personal data to purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate and that the individual has been notified of or deemed to have consented to. The university must have initially collected the alumni data for a specific, reasonable purpose, and the indefinite retention must align with that original purpose or a newly notified purpose for which consent is obtained. If the indefinite retention does not align with a reasonable purpose, it would contravene S 18(1) PDPA.",
  "S 18(2) PDPA": "This provision is relevant as it restricts the use of personal data to the purpose for which it was collected, unless the individual consents, the use is necessary for a purpose set out in the Second Schedule, or the use is directly related to the original purpose. If the university intends to use the alumni data for a new purpose in the future, it must ensure that such use falls within these exceptions; otherwise, indefinite retention for unspecified future purposes would be non-compliant.",
  "S 13 PDPA": "This provision establishes the fundamental requirement of consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal data. The university must have obtained consent from its alumni for the collection and use of their names, addresses, and contact information. If the university intends to retain this data indefinitely, it must ensure that the initial consent obtained covers such long-term retention and potential future uses, or obtain fresh consent."
