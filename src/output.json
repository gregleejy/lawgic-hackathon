This is a practical consideration for the organisation when responding to the access request.\",\n    \"S 21(4) PDPA\": \"This provision is relevant because it specifies the requirements if the organisation declines to provide access to the requested personal data. If the former employer declines to provide access to the performance appraisals, it must inform the former employee of the reason for declining, the provision in the PDPA that authorises the decline, and the individual's right to make a complaint to the Commission.
