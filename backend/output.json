  "S 21(1) PDPA": "This provision is the foundation of the former employee's request, as it establishes the right of an 'individual' to ask an 'organisation' for access to 'personal data' it possesses or controls. The employee's request for a copy of all personal data, including performance appraisals, is a direct exercise of the right granted under S 21(1)(a). The definitions of 'individual', 'organisation', and 'personal data' confirm that the relationship and the data requested fall within the PDPA's scope.",
  "S 21(2) PDPA": "This provision dictates the employer's obligation to comply with the access request but also provides grounds for refusal. While the employer must provide general personal data, it can likely refuse to disclose the performance appraisals under S 21(2)(a), which points to the Fifth Schedule. The Fifth Schedule explicitly creates an exception for 'opinion data for evaluation', which directly applies to performance appraisals. Furthermore, if the appraisals contain comments from managers or peers, the employer could also argue under S 21(2)(b) that disclosure would reveal personal data about another individual.",
  "S 21(4) PDPA": "This provision governs *how* the employer must respond if it chooses to withhold the performance appraisals. If the employer relies on the Fifth Schedule exception to deny access to the appraisals, it is legally required under this section to inform the former employee of the reason for the refusal, the specific provision authorizing it (S 21(2)(a) and the Fifth Schedule), and her right to make a complaint to the 'commission'. This is a mandatory procedural step for a partial or full refusal.",
  "S 21(3) PDPA": "This provision addresses the practical process of disclosure for the data that the employer is obligated to provide (i.e., personal data not covered by an exception). It clarifies that the employer is not required to provide the data for free. The employer may charge the former employee a reasonable fee to cover the costs associated with producing and providing the non-exempt personal data requested."
