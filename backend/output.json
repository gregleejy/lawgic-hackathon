  "S 25 PDPA": "This provision is directly relevant because the university is asking about retaining personal data (names, addresses, and contact information) of its alumni indefinitely. S 25 PDPA states that an organisation must cease to retain documents containing personal data or remove the means by which the personal data can be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that the purpose for which that personal data was collected is no longer being served by retention of the personal data and retention is no longer necessary for any other purpose under the Act or any other written law.",
  "S 18(1) PDPA": "This provision is relevant because it limits the collection of personal data to purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate and that the individual has been notified of. The university must have initially notified the alumni of the purposes for which their data would be collected, used, or disclosed, and indefinite retention must align with those notified purposes. If the initial notification did not include indefinite retention for unspecified future needs, then retaining the data indefinitely may contravene this provision.",
  "S 18(2) PDPA": "This provision is relevant because it restricts the university's use of the alumni's personal data to the purpose for which it was collected, unless the use is consented to by the individual, necessary for a purpose set out in the Second Schedule, or for a purpose that is directly related to the purpose for which the data was collected. The university's desire to retain the data indefinitely 'in case a need for it ever arises' may not be considered a directly related purpose or a purpose the alumni consented to, thus potentially violating this provision if the data is used for a new, unnotified purpose.",
  "S 23 PDPA": "This provision is relevant because if the university retains the alumni data, it must also ensure the accuracy of the data. S 23 PDPA states that an organisation must make a reasonable effort to ensure that personal data collected by or on behalf of the organisation is accurate and complete if the personal data is likely to be used by the organisation to make a decision that affects the individual to whom the personal data relates or the personal data is likely to be disclosed by the organisation to another organisation. Retaining inaccurate data indefinitely increases the risk of non-compliance."
